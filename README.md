# Security Controls & Concepts Exploration

Welcome to my repository dedicated to exploring various security controls and concepts. This repository serves as a resource for understanding the practical aspects of cybersecurity through examples and scripts. 

## Features

- **Security Concepts Demonstrations:** Exploration of security concepts, both old and new school through
source code written in Rust as well as general dialogs. The goal is to break-down ideas into examples that
can be used to understand fundamentals, explore the larger concept, or simply get a grasp of techno-garble.

- **Practical Scripts:** Access a collection of scripts (Rust and Python) designed to automate common security tasks. Many of these might be very simple but focus on improve productivity through the automation of recurring activities. Others are an exploration of various existing scripts through Rust.

- Coming Soon
